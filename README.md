# Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Rest CRUD API for Tutorial Application

This project is a Spring Boot application that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing tutorials. The tutorials have the following attributes: id, title, description, and published status. Additionally, the API supports custom finder methods, allowing users to retrieve tutorials by published status or title.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot: A Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- Spring Data JPA: Part of the larger Spring Data project, it simplifies data access in Spring applications.
- RESTful API: The application follows RESTful principles to expose CRUD operations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains application properties and SQL scripts.
- `src/test`: Contains test cases for the application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- PostgreSQL database
- Your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spring-boot-postgresql-crud-api.git
   ```

2. Configure the PostgreSQL database by updating the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your database connection details.

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

- **Create Tutorial**: `POST /api/tutorials`
  - Request Body: JSON with tutorial details (title, description, published status).
  
- **Get All Tutorials**: `GET /api/tutorials`
  
- **Get Tutorial by ID**: `GET /api/tutorials/{id}`
  
- **Update Tutorial by ID**: `PUT /api/tutorials/{id}`
  - Request Body: JSON with updated tutorial details.
  
- **Delete Tutorial by ID**: `DELETE /api/tutorials/{id}`
  
- **Find Tutorials by Published Status**: `GET /api/tutorials/published?status={status}`
  
- **Find Tutorials by Title**: `GET /api/tutorials?title={title}`

## Sample Requests

### Create Tutorial

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Sample Title","description":"Sample Description","published":true}' http://localhost:8080/api/tutorials
```

### Get All Tutorials

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/tutorials
```
